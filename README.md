PG LESS Utilities
============

Hi, this is a small LESS project to create a bunch of mixins and utilities for LESS stylesheet coding that contains many useful and frequently used css rules and styles. This project was inspired by Bootstrap framework. So if you have experience in Bootstrap, then it's easier to use my utilities. I optimize their LESS structure and try to add more useful mixins as I can. Some styles are not necessary to be used as mixin so I let it be. 

Anyway, you are free to fork and implement any cool features as your choice or share any good idea of yours to me so I can make this utility better.

How to Use
============
You can just download LESS files from the repository and compile them before use. For those who don't know how to compile LESS, I recommend Koala App (http://koala-app.com/) to compile, it's a GUI compiler and very easy to use.

Demo

The demo website is now under the improvement process, sorry for inconvenience. But if you are familiar with LESS or Bootstrap, I'm sure you can use it easily just by looking at my code.
